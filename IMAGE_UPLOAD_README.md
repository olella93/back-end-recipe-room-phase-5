3. **Owner Authorization** - Users can only upload to their own recipes
4. **Secure Naming** - Unique filenames prevent conflicts and exposure
5. **Cloud Storage** - Images stored securely on Cloudinary, not local server

## Database Schema

The image URLs are stored in the existing database fields:

**Users Table:**
- `profile_image` (VARCHAR(255)) - Cloudinary URL for profile image

**Recipes Table:**
- `image_url` (VARCHAR(255)) - Cloudinary URL for recipe image

## Integration Notes

- **Frontend Integration**: The API returns direct Cloudinary URLs that can be used immediately in `<img>` tags
- **Image Optimization**: All images are automatically optimized for web delivery
- **CDN Delivery**: Images are served via Cloudinary's global CDN for fast loading
- **Responsive Images**: Cloudinary URLs support on-the-fly transformations for responsive design
